# How to contribute translations

Godot's translation work is coordinated on
[Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot),
an open source web-based translation platform, where contributors can work
together on translations using various internationalization features.
Creating an account there is free, and you can also login directly with
your GitHub, BitBucket, Google or Facebook account.

To avoid merge conflicts when syncing translations from Weblate (currently
this is done manually), we ask all contributors to work there instead of
making pull requests on this repository.

## Adding new languages

If you want to translate for a language which is not featured yet on Weblate,
open an issue on this repo to ask that the language is added, or contact
Akien/@akien-mga directly on IRC (#godotengine channel on Freenode).
